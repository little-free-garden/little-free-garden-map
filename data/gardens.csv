A message from Gary Aitken Jr. Ki suk kyukyit, Our proud people have been stewards of this fine land since time immemorial. When placed here, the creator made a covenant with the Ktunaxa people telling us “I have created you Kootenai people to look after this beautiful land, to honor, and guard, and celebrate my creation here, in this place. As long as you do that, this land will meet all of your needs…” This covenant has been our sacred doctrine and driving force ever since. It was set forth in our beginning and we hold it dear to this very day. Overcoming adversity and rising above challenges is the hallmark of our people. Resiliency is carried with us as a badge of honor. A long line of strong leadership with a prescient emphasis on securing a better future for our people has led to our success. Our love of our people and community has helped us work with an extraordinary amount of people, including governmental and non-governmental entities, to achieve common goals and help us benefit our community as well as do our part to uphold our covenant. The collaborative efforts have led us to develop thriving relationships that span cultural, social, jurisdictional, political, and geographical boundaries. Recognizing that all things are connected has led to the Kootenai Tribe being innovators in ecosystem recovery. The holistic approach that comes natural to our people has provided a clear path forward in our species restoration efforts. We, as a Tribe, are proud of the remarkable ecosystem work we have been able to accomplish. We are also proud of our business ventures such as the Kootenai River Inn Casino and Spa. Our sumptuous resort has provided the Tribe and its member’s financial stability and has been a tremendous enhancement to the local community and economy. Through the success of our resort we are able to provide our people education and employment opportunities, as well as supplement programs designed for our members’ health and well-being. In our territory, farther than the eye can see, there are no places that Kootenai footsteps have not touched. With forward-minded guidance, continued honoring of past accomplishments and struggles, and a respectful way of engaging others, we will move forward into the future in a good way. Hu suki q’ukni.

Our Story - Our story begins on September 14, 1999 in Sandpoint, Idaho.  Quality Farm & Garden had had a store there for 7 years.  My Grandfather had a feed store, I grew up with dogs, chickens, rabbits and all sorts of animals.  I was looking for something that allowed me to draw from that experience.   We saw an opportunity to continue to support the Farm & Garden needs of the community when Quality wanted to sell. A funny story from our first days open:  So this guy comes in and looks at me, puts his head back looks around the store, looks back at me and says in a very loud voice “Where’s Daryl?”  Well, I said, I’m the new owner, my name is Charlie.   He stares back at the store surroundings, looks back at me, throws his shoulder back and says well I’ll be gol darned (amended) we got us a Sasquatch! All joking aside  –  I take great pride in our stores and am deeply appreciative of our customers, employees and community organizations that support us.   We look forward to meeting you in either our Bonners Ferry, ID or Sandpoint , ID stores.  “You Know It!”",,"6127 Main Street Bonners Ferry, ID 83805",48.668138,-116.336700
